Card Game Assignment

When creating the Hand classes, I initialised type as an argument so each method could operate according
to the rules of each game type hand. I also created a seperate method size which would calculate the size
of the hand that is being tested.

I apologise for not including any test classes, and also for the distinct lack of GitHub usage, I could not
get it to work and as you can see, I was running out of time.
